# Assesment-1
this is the first Assesment
# Code Challenges (Set 1) â€”-----------------------
1. Write a program that takes a string and capitalizes the fi rst letter of each word. Example input: "hello world". output: "Hello World
2. Write a program that counts how many times the letter "a" appears in the string "JavaScript is amazing!".
3. Write a while loop to print the fi rst 5 multiples of 3.
# Code Challenges (Set 2) â€”-----------------------
1. Write a function named fi zzBuzz that takes in two(2) parameters, which are expected to be strings. The function should return the string Fizz if the combined length of the parameters is divisible by 3, the string Buzz if it is divisible by 5, and the string FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3.
2. Write a JavaScript program that prompts a user to enter their year of birth and, in turn, prints a string in the console stating whether the user is a minor, a youth, or an elder. Anyone below 18 years is a minor, anyone between 18 and 36 years is a youth, and the rest are elders. 3. Write a function named twoSum that takes two parameters: nums and target. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
# Code Challenges (Set 3) â€”-----------------------
Given an Array containing integers, fl oats, and one-character strings, write a function that takes an Array as a parameter and returns an Object with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is an array of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers, and chars is a list of sorted single-character strings.
Example Input:
Expected output:
2. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct. 

3. Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. ðŸ“Œ Project
